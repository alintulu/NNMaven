# Neural Network

This repository contains a neural network built in Java for the course of OhjelmistoTekniikan Menetelm√§ 
(OTM) at the University of Helsinki. The network works on poly-dimensional input data however it comes with a 
ready built method to train and validate it on one-dimensional inpu data of a cosine curve.

The network uses the activation function of the sigmoid curve and the optimizer of gradient descent.
It performs well on one-dimensional input data however the performance declines quickly as the dimensions increase.
The current performance can be seen [here](https://github.com/alintulu/NNMaven/blob/master/src/README.md).

The source code 
is located in the folder [src](https://github.com/alintulu/NNMaven/tree/master/src). Instructions how
to employ the network and basic knowledge of the network and output is located in the folder 
[documentation](https://github.com/alintulu/NNMaven/tree/master/documentation).
